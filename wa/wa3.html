        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong><em>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</em></strong> is a 2006 American fantasy swashbuckler film directed by Gore Verbinski, written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, 
            and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), it is the second installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. 
            Set one year after the events of The Curse of the Black Pearl, the film recounts Captain Jack Sparrow owing a debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the ghastly captain of the Flying Dutchman, 
            and being marked for death and pursued by the Kraken. Meanwhile, the wedding of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is interrupted by 
            Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), who wants Turner to acquire Jack's magic compass in a bid to find the Dead Man's Chest.
            <br><br>
            Two sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl were conceived in 2004, with Elliott and Rossio developing a story arc that would span both films. Filming took place 
            from February to September 2005 in Palos Verdes, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, and The Bahamas, as well as on sets constructed at Walt Disney Studios. It was shot back-to-back 
            with the third film of the series, At World's End (2007).
            <br><br>
            Dead Man's Chest was released in the United States on July 7, 2006, and received mixed reviews from critics. The film broke several records at the time, including the opening-weekend record 
            in the United States with $136 million, the fastest film to gross over $1 billion at the worldwide box office (63 days), became the highest-grossing film of 2006, the third highest-grossing 
            film of all time at the time of its release, and was the highest-grossing film produced by Disney until it was surpassed by Toy Story 3 in 2010. The film received four nominations at the 
            79th Academy Awards (winning Best Visual Effects).

        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's wedding is interrupted by Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company, who arrives at Port Royal with arrest warrants, charging them for aiding 
            Captain Jack Sparrow's escape.[a] Despite also having a warrant, Commodore James Norrington resigned from the Royal Navy and disappeared after losing his ship, HMS Dauntless, in a hurricane 
            while pursuing Jack.
            <br><br>
            Meanwhile, aboard the Black Pearl, Jack is visited by Will's father, Bootstrap Bill Turner, who is now a crewman of the Flying Dutchman, captained by Davy Jones.[b] He marks Jack with the 
            Black Spot and reminds him that he previously bartered a deal with Jones to raise the Pearl from the depths in exchange for his freedom, a debt Jack failed to repay, and must now serve aboard 
            the Dutchman or he will be dragged into Davy Jones' Locker by the Kraken. Meanwhile, revealing Letters of Marque intended for Jack Sparrow signed by King George, Beckett offers to free Will 
            and Elizabeth in exchange for Will recovering Sparrow's compass.
            <br><br>
            Will finds Jack and his crew on an island and helps them escape from cannibals. Afterward, Jack visits voodoo priestess Tia Dalma, who helps in finding the Dead Man's Chest, which holds Davy Jones' 
            still-beating heart. Jack intends to find it and free himself from Jones' debt. Will makes a deal with Jack to find the key to the chest in return for Jack's compass but is tricked into servitude 
            with Jones' crew aboard the Dutchman in Jack's stead. Jones agrees to free Sparrow from servitude if he can provide 99 more souls. Will reunites with his father, Bootstrap Bill, aboard the Dutchman 
            and learns that Jones possesses the key through Liar's Dice. Will escapes with the key and climbs aboard the Edinburgh Trader. Jones summons the Kraken and sinks the ship, but Will manages to escape.
            <br><br>
            Meanwhile, Elizabeth's father, Governor Swann, breaks her out of prison but is captured himself. Elizabeth steals the Letters of Marque from Beckett and makes her way to Tortuga, where she finds both 
            Jack and a drunken Norrington. Jack tricks Elizabeth into using his compass to find Jones' chest. All parties arrive on Isla Cruces, where the chest is buried. A three-way sword fight breaks out 
            between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all want the heart for their respective goals: Jack wants to call off the Kraken and negate his debt to Jones; Will wants to release his father from the Dutchman; 
            and Norrington wants to regain his life as a Navy officer. In the chaos, Norrington secretly steals the heart and the Letters of Marque before running off, pretending to lure away the Dutchman crew. 
            Jones and the Kraken attacks the Pearl, killing most of the crew and destroys all but one of the Pearl's lifeboats. Jack uses the boat to briefly flee the battle but comes back to help wound the Kraken 
            with a net full of gunpowder and rum.
            <br><br>
            Jack orders the survivors to abandon ship, but Elizabeth realizes the Kraken only wants Jack. Elizabeth tricks Jack by chaining him to the mast so that the crew can escape while the Kraken drags Jack 
            and the Pearl to the depths. Davy Jones, seemingly satisfied that Sparrow's debt is settled, opens the chest to find his heart missing. Norrington gives Beckett the Letters and Jones' heart, reinstating 
            him back into the Navy as well as allowing the East India Trading Company to gain control of Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman, and the Kraken. Jack's crew returns to Tia Dalma, where they agree about 
            the possibility of rescuing Sparrow at World's End. Tia Dalma introduces the captain who will guide them: the resurrected Hector Barbossa.

         <h3>The Battle of Isla Cruces</h3>
         <p><img src="/img/Isla_Cruces_duel_1.jpg" alt="Image of Jack, Norrington, and Will fighting on the beach of Isla Cruces" style="float: left;width: 600px;height: 230px"></p>
         <p>
            <strong>Betrayals</strong>
            <br><br>
            With the chest dug up, Sparrow, Swann, and Norrington put their ears to the chest to see if the chest was really what Jack told them it was. They heard Davy Jones heart beat within the chest. Norrington 
            couldn't believe it, who thought Jack was a liar. Will Turner showed up on the beach shore, claiming Norrington had good reason.
            <br><br>
            Will revealed that it was Jack who got Will stuck on the Flying Dutchman, and explained to everyone that his father still lives. Will then pulled the key to the chest out, which he had stolen from Davy Jones 
            while Jones was sleeping. As Will was getting ready to stab the heart, Sparrow pulled his sword out and threatened Will. If Jones was slain, no one could call off the Kraken. Will then stole Elizabeth's sword, 
            and told Jack he was going to free his father by stabbing the heart. Norrington then pulled out his sword, claiming that if he took the heart to the East India Trading Company, he would get his life back. 
            Norrington then threw the first swing at Jack.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Duel for the Key</strong>
            <br><br>
            The three pirates then began a duel on the beaches, with Elizabeth cursing them for being pirates. Pintel and Ragetti showed up,and stole the chest and ran off into the island's jungle. Sparrow, Turner, 
            and Norrington ended up in an abandoned church dueling. Maccus and more members of the Flying Dutchman's crew showed up at the beaches. Will set off a church bell, which acted as a beacon to 
            the members of the Flying Dutchman. Jack managed to steal the key, and began to set off to the chest. But Norrington and Turner accidentally broke an old water mill off of a building, sending the wheel 
            down the jungle floor, the three pirates dueling within it.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Behind the Scenes</strong>
            <br><br>
            To pull off the stunt, all the principal actors in the scene did numerous hours of stunt traning and sword fighting practice to be able to remember the choreography even while being strapped to a moving wheel. The swords and 
            techniques learned are similar to the modern day sport of <a href="http://arsn8930.github.io/wa/wa_3.html">fencing</a>.

         <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>Following the success of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), the cast and crew signed on for two more sequels to be shot back-to-back,[6] a practical decision on Disney's part 
                to allow more time with the same cast and crew.[7] Writer Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio decided not to make the sequels new adventures featuring the same characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, 
                but to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy.[8] They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace at the end 
                of the first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device.[9] They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken. They also introduced the historical 
                East India Trading Company, who for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.[10]
                <br><br>
                Planning began in June 2004, and production was much larger than The Curse of the Black Pearl, which was only shot on location in St. Vincent.[11] This time, the sequels would require fully working ships, 
                with a working Black Pearl built over the body of an oil tanker in Bayou La Batre, Alabama. By November, the script was still unfinished as the writers did not want director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer 
                to compromise what they had written, so Verbinski worked with James Byrkit to storyboard major sequences without need of a script, while Elliott and Rossio wrote a "preparatory" script for the crew to use before 
                they finished the script they were happy with. By January 2005, with rising costs and no script, Disney executives threatened to cancel the film, but changed their minds. The writers would accompany the crew on location, 
                feeling that the lateness of their rewrites would improve the spontaneity of the cast's performances.[9]

         <h3>Filming</h3>
            <p>
                Principal photography began on February 28, 2005,[12] in Palos Verdes, beginning with Elizabeth's ruined wedding day.[9] For Cutler Beckett's introduction, Rossio and Elliott had him arrive on shore in a boat while sitting 
                on a horse standing in the boat; the duo had originally planned to use this introduction for Don Rafael Montero in The Mask of Zorro (1998), but the scene was cut for being deemed too expensive. Similarly, the Pirates crew 
                wanted to cut the idea for budget reasons, in addition to feel that it would be unbelievable, or as the film's historian dismissed, suicidal. However, Verbinski promised Rossio and Elliott to use the idea and the scene was 
                filmed in one day after weeks of planning and training.[13] The crew spent the first shooting days at Walt Disney Studios in Los Angeles, including the interiors of the Black Pearl and the Edinburgh Trader which Elizabeth 
                stows away on,[12] before moving to St. Vincent to shoot the scenes in Port Royal and Tortuga. Sets from the previous film were reused, having survived three hurricanes, although the main pier had to be rebuilt as it
                had collapsed in November. The crew had four tall ships at their disposal to populate the backgrounds, which were painted differently on each side for economy.[7] One of the ships used was the replica of HMS Bounty used 
                in the 1962 film adaptation of Mutiny on the Bounty.[14][15]
                <br><br>
                On April 18, 2005,[16] the crew began shooting at Dominica, a location Verbinski had selected as he felt it fitted the sense of remoteness he was looking for.[9] However, this was also a problem; the Dominican 
                government were completely unprepared for the scale of a Hollywood production, and the 500-strong crew occupying around 90% of the roads on the island had trouble moving around on the underdeveloped surfaces. 
                The weather also alternated between torrential rainstorms and hot temperatures, the latter of which was made worse for the cast who had to wear period clothing. At Dominica, the sequences involving Pelegosto (Cannibal Island) 
                and the forest segment of the battle on Isla Cruces were shot. Verbinski preferred to use practical props for the giant wheel and bone cage sequences, feeling long close-up shots would help further suspend the audience's disbelief.
                [7] Dominica was also used for Tia Dalma's shack. Filming on the island concluded on May 26, 2005.[17]
                <br><br>
                The crew moved to a small island in the Bahamas called White Cay for the beginning and end of the Isla Cruces battle,[7] before production took a break until August, where in Los Angeles the interiors of the Flying Dutchman were shot.
                [18] On September 18, 2005,[19] the crew moved to Grand Bahama Island to shoot ship exteriors, including the working Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman. Filming there was a tumultuous period, starting with the fact that the tank
                had not actually been finished. The hurricane season caused many pauses in shooting, and Hurricane Wilma damaged many of the accessways and pumps, though no one was hurt nor were any of the ships destroyed.
                [7] Principal photography was completed on September 10, 2005.[20]
                <br><br>
                The look of the Flying Dutchman was partially inspired by old Dutch "fluyts"—17th-century vessels which resembled galleons—and more specifically, the Vasa, a massive Swedish warship which sank in Stockholm's harbor upon its maiden 
                voyage in 1628 (the ship was salvaged in 1961 and housed in a special museum in the Swedish capital). With its high, heavily ornamented stern, the ship provided a rich foundation for Rick Heinrichs' wilder and more fantastical designs.[21][22]
                <br><br>
                One of the stuntmen, Johnny Depp's stunt double Tony Angelotti, was injured on set while filming a "human yo-yo" stunt in July 2005. He was rushed to hospital, suffering internal bleeding after "nicking" a branch off his femoral artery. 
                He lost six units of blood, had an ACL reconstruction and spent a year in recovery, before having to have the surgery all over again when a plate in his pelvis broke. He also suffered from PTSD. Despite this, he did continue filming for 
                the following sequel, At World's End, albeit doing "lighter stunts" like sword choreography or working as a stunt coordinator. However, in 2007, Tony Angelotti did sue Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer for the injury.[23][24]

                The Flying Dutchman's crew members were originally conceived by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio as ghosts, but Gore Verbinski disliked this and designed them as physical creatures.[25] Their hierarchy is reflected by how mutated they were: 
                newcomers had low level infections which resemble rosacea, while veterans had full-blown undersea creature attributes. Verbinski wanted to keep them realistic, rejecting a character with a turtle shell, and the animators watched various 
                David Attenborough documentaries to study the movement of sea anemones and mussels.[26] All of the crew are computer-generated, with the exception of Stellan Skarsgård, who played "Bootstrap" Bill Turner. Initially his prosthetics would be 
                augmented with CGI but that was abandoned.[27] Skarsgård spent four hours in the make-up chair and was dubbed "Bouillabaisse" on set.[28]
                <br><br>
                Davy Jones had originally been designed with chin growths, before the designers made the move to full-blown tentacles;[29] the skin of the character incorporates the texture of a coffee-stained Styrofoam cup among other elements. To portray Jones 
                on set, Bill Nighy wore a motion capture tracksuit that meant the animators at Industrial Light & Magic did not have to reshoot the scene in the studio without him or on the motion capture stage. Nighy wore make-up around his eyes and mouth to splice 
                into the computer-generated shots, but the images of his eyes and mouth were not used. Nighy only wore a prosthetic once, with blue-colored tentacles for when Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) steals the key to the Dead Man's Chest from under his "beard" 
                as he sleeps. To create the CGI version of the character, the model was closely based on a full-body scan of Nighy, with Jones reflecting his high cheekbones. Animators studied every frame of Nighy's performance: the actor himself had blessed them 
                by making his performance more quirky than expected, providing endless fun for them. His performance also meant new controls had to be stored. Finally, Jones' tentacles are mostly a simulation, though at times they were hand-animated when they act 
                as limbs for the character.[30]
                <br><br>
                The Kraken was difficult to animate as it had no real-life reference, until animation director Hal Hickel instructed the crew to watch King Kong vs. Godzilla which featured a live octopus crawling over miniatures.[31] On the set, two pipes filled with 
                30,000 pounds (14,000 kg) of cement were used to crash and split the Edinburgh Trader: Completing the illusion are miniature masts and falling stuntmen shot on a bluescreen stage. The scene where the Kraken spits at Jack Sparrow does not use computer-generated 
                spit: it was real slime thrown at Johnny Depp.[32]
